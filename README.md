### Alcohol consumption analysis using machine learning

This dissertation examines the relationship between personal traits and alcohol consumption to identify trends contributing to higher intake. Using publicly available statistics, the study investigates the physical, social, and demographic characteristics of individuals consuming 12 or more alcoholic beverages annually.

To ensure data integrity, the study begins with comprehensive data collection and preparation, followed by exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships among variables. Predictive modeling techniques including deep neural networks, gradient boosting, random forests, and decision trees are employed to forecast consumption patterns, with model performances compared using various metrics.

The results emphasize the effectiveness of gradient boosting in anticipating consumption trends and offer insights into influential features through feature importance analysis. Ethical considerations are carefully addressed throughout the research process.

In summary, this study bridges the gap between data science methodologies and the social implications of alcohol use, contributing to discussions on predictive modeling's societal impact. It underscores the importance of ethical data usage and precision in predictions, highlighting the potential for ethical interventions to address alcohol consumption patterns.
